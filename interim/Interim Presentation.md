# Interim Report

# Caio

We began by talking to Kitty with what she would like us to do. She got
us started on looking into the UK market, and what applications the box
would work on. We looked into the currently available options, but none
of them seemed appropriate. We asked for kittys market research, and
found that typically vaccination travel rounds last for upwards of 5
hours, which is already enough that a medic may not wish to extend this
time further.

We talked to personal connections we know to see if there would be a
smaller personal ice box market, however this also backfired, as most
people in that market would not need their medication cold dor much
longer than a few hours, and can do so with a small box when on holiday
etc.

The conclusion we came to was that the NHS market was no good. We
proposed a second market to Kitty of a third world country where the
journeys are less dangerous than those currently taken, but still
require a lot of vaccinations in one go. We then looked at current large
capacity cold boxes, and how the existing smile addresses those issues.

Current options… £500 gets you an electric vaccine cooler, so need to
lower the price towards the £200 range. Looking at insulation can be
useful to try and reduce cost, but can let kitty do this as it would be
more involved for the manufacturing process.

All options seem to be just boxes with handles and seem to be very
expensive. Smile does fix this sort of.

# Objectives 

Following the market research we have settled on the following objectives for completion within the project timeframe:

### Carrying mechanism (straps) design
- Design carrying mechamism to replace the backpack of the large smile as it is unnecessary for shorter journeys
- Work on making this modular and with potential to fit large smile with standardised fastenings
- Integrate vaccine recording method into straps design

### Design for modular carousel
- Look at ways to make parts modular for use in both big and mini smile
- Develop simplicity of carousel for maintenace, cleaning and replacement
- Design for maximum number of vaccines in smaller smile
- Prototype and test

### Design new method to keep bottle central in chamber 
- Replace the bearing that was used in large smile, as the off the shelf bottle does not have the required recess

### Perform thermal analysis to aid rescaling of smile
- Use high level analysis and heat transfer software to develop understanding of the effects of rescaling

## Thermal Analysis

Time that the Mini Smile can maintain vaccine between 2 and 8 degrees:
### $\frac{t_1}{t_2} = \frac{x_1^2A_2V_1\lambda_2}{x_2^2A_1V_2\lambda_1}$
where $A$ is the surface area of the bottle, $V$ is the volume of the bottle, $x$ is the wall thickness and $\lambda$ is the heat conductivity of the insulation material. We know that $t_1$ is approximately 120 hours, $x_1$ is approximately 5 cm and $V_1$ is 2.5 L for the original Smile.
We want $t_2 > 24$ hours for the Mini Smile, and we know that $V_2 = 1$ L, $\frac{\lambda_2}{\lambda_1} = 1$ and $\frac{A_2}{A_1} = 0.54$, therefore we need:
### $x_2 > 2.6$ cm


## Mass Analysis

Mass of the Mini Smile:
### $m = m_{empty} + \rho_wV = \rho_mAx + \rho_wV$
where $A$ is the surface area of the bottle, $V$ is the volume of the bottle, $x$ is the wall thickness, $\rho_w$ is the density of water and $\rho_m$ is the approximate calculated density of the insulaton and shell combined.
$V_1 = 0.0025$ m<sup>3</sup>, $V_2 = 0.001$ m<sup>3</sup>, $\rho_w = 1000$ kg/m<sup>3</sup>, $x_1 = 0.055$ m, $x_2 = 0.026$ m, $A_1 = 0.003$ m<sup>2</sup>, $A_2 = 0.0016$ m<sup>2</sup> and $m_{1,empty} = 3.5$ kg. Therefore,
### $\rho_m = \frac{m_{1,empty}}{A_1x_1}$
Hence,
### $m_{2,empty} = \rho_mA_2x_2 = 0.9$ kg
### $m_2 = m_{2,empty} + \rho_wV_2 = 1.9$ kg

## Strap Design

I have started prototyping different modular strap designs to test for both the Smile and the Mini Smile. I started by creating a mock-up of the Mini Smile out of cardboard, shown below:

![](https://github.com/Technology-for-the-Poorest-Billion/2024-ideabatic-smirk/blob/main/interim/photographs/IMG_20240525_181334368.jpg)

I then designed and prototyped modular attaching clips which can be glued to botht the Smile and the Mini Smile. These allow interchangeable straps to be attached to the Mini Smile/Smile, and thus allow user customisability to attach whatever strap configuration is most comfortable for them. The straps can also be removed, allowing the box to be used un-altered as before. Photographs of the attachment points are below:

![](https://github.com/Technology-for-the-Poorest-Billion/2024-ideabatic-smirk/blob/main/interim/photographs/IMG_20240525_181409278.jpg)

Straps were then prototyped out of cardboard with a width of 40mm. I plan on trying these out, along with 70mm-wide straps on a field test where I walk around with the Smile protoype weighted to the correct mass. This will allow me to identify which set of straps is more ergonomic, and the modularity of the strap-retaining mechanism glued to the box means that both I, and any end user, can easily swap of straps for the most comfortable for them. Perhaps it will be suggested that the default Smile straps are thicker than the default Mini Smile ones due to the higher anticipated weight of the Smile. However the straps will of course be interchangeable. Here are some photographs of the straps:

![](https://github.com/Technology-for-the-Poorest-Billion/2024-ideabatic-smirk/blob/main/interim/photographs/IMG_20240525_181429904.jpg)

And how they attach to the box:

![](https://github.com/Technology-for-the-Poorest-Billion/2024-ideabatic-smirk/blob/main/interim/photographs/IMG_20240525_181504778.jpg)

I have completed some preliminary field tests with the straps, and these are photographed below:

![](https://github.com/Technology-for-the-Poorest-Billion/2024-ideabatic-smirk/blob/main/interim/photographs/IMG_3840.jpeg)

![](https://github.com/Technology-for-the-Poorest-Billion/2024-ideabatic-smirk/blob/main/interim/photographs/IMG_3839.jpeg)

I have also explored the possibility of front-mounting the Mini Smile. Advantages of this include enhanced protection for the vaccines (unlikely to bump the Mini Smile into things), and possible on-the-fly acces to the Mini Smile's contents.

![](https://github.com/Technology-for-the-Poorest-Billion/2024-ideabatic-smirk/blob/main/interim/photographs/IMG_20240525_155927525.jpg)

At the moment the straps have to be held to keep the Mini Smile in place, but I am exploring options for lengthening the straps and attaching both ends to the Mini Smile so that it can be carried hands-free.

Since last presentation I have developed my rapid protoyping skills, using cardboard to speed up the process, and my high-level analysis by performing back-of-the-envelope calculations for the Mini Smile's mass and insulation thickness. In terms of personal development I have furthered my teamworking and communication skills by working closely with Livvy and Caio throughout the project.
# Caio
This is linked to the pdf attached which prototypes the different possible ideas

### 1. 
![image](https://github.com/Technology-for-the-Poorest-Billion/2024-ideabatic-smirk/assets/98715298/116eb623-6eaa-4455-b5d0-288cad967d8c)

Simply making the carousel smaller. It works well as the design is already there, and would be easy to assemble and repair, but  form experience it is very easy to pull off by accident, and takes a few minutes to get right

### 2.
![image](https://github.com/Technology-for-the-Poorest-Billion/2024-ideabatic-smirk/assets/98715298/d588fd9f-5ed0-4458-bc90-2dd9d8ac796b)

Idea to make it one long slab, which can be modular for any size of smile. Puzzle attachment is probably nto the most secure, but allows complete modularity without much change in the design. Need to run heat analysis on it

### 3.
![image](https://github.com/Technology-for-the-Poorest-Billion/2024-ideabatic-smirk/assets/98715298/02027fe4-6aaf-494e-9d45-db6cdfdf2d45)

Having a capsule for needles etc is something to be explored. Can fit in the same gap as the current butterfly attachment. Big issue since currently the bag is used to carry the extra bits, but is just too big.

### 4.
![image](https://github.com/Technology-for-the-Poorest-Billion/2024-ideabatic-smirk/assets/98715298/b0c35cef-76a1-4eec-9e9e-a543ec2a7609)

Using foam inserts. Is a lot simpler, acts as insulation, and is incredibly easily repaired. Will break a lot quicker, which may be ok if the hospital is well off.

### 5.
![image](https://github.com/Technology-for-the-Poorest-Billion/2024-ideabatic-smirk/assets/98715298/12981f6d-5f62-45cb-8797-9b50a512932f)

Same benefits and issues as before, but is more versatile so can stuff anything within the small crevices. 

### 6/7.
![image](https://github.com/Technology-for-the-Poorest-Billion/2024-ideabatic-smirk/assets/98715298/da2b7ced-1341-4006-94b6-794943893b2c)
![image](https://github.com/Technology-for-the-Poorest-Billion/2024-ideabatic-smirk/assets/98715298/55a2cd22-731d-47df-8fc5-d360c397766a)


Straps sewn onto foam (have seen before) Can work quite well. If careful with it will last a long time, and can be easily taped up without losing protection. would be very cheap to produce, incredibly modular, much more versatile, and a much flatter profile. Startup cost much lower but might end up being more expensive per part
### 8.
![image](https://github.com/Technology-for-the-Poorest-Billion/2024-ideabatic-smirk/assets/98715298/b3b046a9-d132-48a2-a2c2-baf0e0851d8c)

Looking at how it will be fitted, and how it can be replaced

## Olivia
I have developed my skills in python modelling and visualisation, and understanding of heat transfer. 

# Next steps
all work up to and onwards from this point can be seen in Interim/code/thermal analysis.md

* Produce analysis with convective heat transfer in vaccine chamber to produce an upper bound for heat transfer.
* Investigate materials to support bottle in cavity - high thermal conductivity but also compressibility
* Prototype bottle support mechanism with this in mind
* Perform experiments to measure expansion of bottle when frozen, once the ordered bottle arrives.


## Caio
I have develiped my rapid prototyping skills, as well as how to communicate the design reasonings effectvely
I have also developed my cad skills specifically when working with existing models.
