                It's official!<br>
                Unibots 2026 is officially happening! After the success of last year, we decided to bring back Unibots bigger and better than ever with a new format and more events.

                <h2>New for 2026</h2>
                This year we are introducing Regionals! We want to help everyone across the country and enable them to have a taste of the arena and competition format before the Finals in July, and to help you practice in a tournament setting.<br> 
                More information to come soon!

                    <h3>Intermediate-level Competition</h3>
                    <p>We designed the competition to allow anyone who has elementary experience with robotics to be able to build and compete.</p>
                    <p>For 2026, robots will go head to head to compete in the arena, trying to collect as many ping pong and steel balls as possible.</p>
                    <p>Our competition will be great fun for competitors with any level of experience!</p>

                    <p>The regionals will be held across the UK before the final event as a one day competition, with dates to be announced soon. In these you'll get to practice and improve your robot to be one step closer to winning the two day event in July</p>
                    <p>The competition is a great way to meet other students that are as passionate about robotics as you are.</p>
                    <p>Dates for Regionals (one-day event) - Exact Locations to be confirmed by December:<br>
    Cambridge: March 2026 (date TBD).<br>
    Edinburgh: Saturday 28 February 2026 at Heriot-Watt University.<br>
