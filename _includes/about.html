        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
            Unibots is an inter-university robotics competition where teams build autonomous
            robots to accomplish a defined competition task. Registration is free for students
            from universities across the UK.
        </p>

        <p>
            Created in 2022 by students from the University of Cambridge and King’s College London,
            the competition format has evolved each year with new objectives and scoring systems.
        </p>

        <p>
            The fourth edition of Unibots is co-hosted by the University of Cambridge Robotics Society,
            Heriot-Watt University Robotics Society, and Queen Mary University of London Electronics Society.
        </p>

        <h2>Accessibility & Competition Format</h2>
        <p>
            The competition is designed with manageable tasks that have a linear effort-to-reward
            ratio. A simple playing field, clear-cut rules, and a friendly atmosphere make Unibots
            accessible to less experienced students or those without access to large funding sources
            or institutional support.
        </p>

        <p>
            Robots compete directly against one another in the same arena, encouraging friendly
            rivalries between teams and creating an engaging, high-energy competition environment.
        </p>

        <h2>Our Vision</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Build a nationwide community of robotics-focused students</li>
            <li>Inspire the next generation of engineers and roboticists</li>
            <li>Empower students to apply university knowledge in real-world systems</li>
            <li>Create networking opportunities across UK universities</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            We aim to grow Unibots into a strong inter-university network, strengthening collaboration
            between robotics societies across the UK.
