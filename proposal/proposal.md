# Problem description

The problem we are tackling is that of last mile vaccine transportation to rural areas in high income countries. These areas include rural areas of Scotland and Wales, and will often be to people who are immobile and unable to travel to a vaccination centre, such as the elderly. Current vaccination transportation cool boxes are poorly designed, and as a result vaccination workers often don't use them properly with too few ice packs being used and the box lid being left off during vaccination. This results in a significant portion of cool boxes where the temperature exceeds the allowed 2 to 8 degree range and so the vaccines spoil. Our goal is to reduce the amount of vaccine spoilt by creating a well-designed cooler that mitigates the above problems. The engineering approach we will use is to model prototypes in CAD software before using novel manufacturing techniques such as 3D printing to create physical prototypes. Should we have time, we will then run tests on these prototypes.

# Presentation of the proposal
We will begin with defining the problem, isolating the key components and determining their importance in the final design. This will help us get a feel for the current design and design considerations that must be taken when determining what to shrink, and how that would best be done. We will begin by looking at the threee major parts of the project: The lid, the carousel, The straps, and the box itself, and we will try and make it smaller so as to fit the 1L ice pack proposed by Kitty. 
The initial end goals are:

**The Lid:**
The lid has already gone through a lot of iterations on simplifying the design, but more work could be done for a more scalable design. Right now the lid assembly consists of ~5 components. these may not scale perfectly to the smaller sizes while still being robust, and so we will be looking into how to shrink the lid opening, while still making the vaccines easily reachable and without significantly weakening the hinge

**The Carousel:**
Currently the carousel is incredibly complex with a lot of moving parts, and modular vaccine holders. While this is good for versatility in areas where the vaccine bottles could be many sizes, the extra moulds required makes this a challenge to scale. We will look at ways to secutely hold the vaccine in such a way that they will not break during transit, while making them easy to take out from the inside.

Another route we can look into is how the ice pack will fit into the central section of the carousel. This is currently done through a squishy section attached onto the locknig part of the ice pack holder, but there are multiple other ways we can improve this design to be scaled down in such a way that a 1L ice bottle can fit.

**The straps:**
We will also think about how this would be carried around, through looking at different types of straps like a sling bag, a backpack, or a lunchbox style to name a few.

**The Box:**
The box is a design that can be played with, however we do not want to change the design language of the product, nor do we want to risk changing the already agreed upon design too much, and so we will look into what scale the whole box will be, and try to fit the other components onto this hypothetical scale

After coming up with concrete ideas on paper, we will begin rudimentary 3d modelling of the final sketches, and start 3d printing said models to analyse what works and what doesn't. After the rapid prototyping and testing against the provided box, we will begin to refine our best ideas and attempt to create a more finalised 3d model which will be be ready to be delivered and in a finished state for the route we go down.

There will not be enough time for us to look through all of these, but as we consider and sketch up ideas for the existing problems, we will isolate a few that we thnk have the most potential for improvement, and further explore those till the end. This may not be evident until further into the development cycle, but will allow us to focus our time more effectively in the detailed prototype stage.
A full model with testing of the completed scaled down version may not be feasible, however rough calculations will be made so as to ensure the ice box will work for prolonged periods of time at a reasonable scale.

 

# Assessment of the quality of the proposal
**Responsible**

The proposal should cause no harm as the technology developed cannot easily be used in a harmful way. The safety of the product will be considered during the design of any rotating mechanims and the self-closing door, to reduce the risk to the health worker when using it. We must also consider the quality and safety of the materials and insulation used as they will be used in a medical environment, although not in direct contact with sterile equipment or the vaccines.

The ice pack bottle used if made form HDPE so could be recycled at end of life. Sustainably sourced or recycled materials should be considered for use in the shell and insulation, but compatibility with manufaturing methods must also be considered to reduce the cost of the end product. As a part of reducing the size of the cooler we will try to simplify the design and make it more modular, which will increase ease of dissassembly and recycling at end-of-life.

**Responds to a genuine need and adds significant value**

This product will not be responding to a need that doesnt already have a solution as there are many different brands of cooler currently used in the UK for transporting vaccines and other medications. It should however provide an improvement compared to these products as it will have a longer cool-life, improved organisation of vaccines around the icepack and an improved door with self closing mechanism to reduce heat gained when it is used, as seen in the origional SMILE coolbox. This should make it easier to use than similar products already on the market, and maintain temperature range the vaccines are kept at to increase their lifetime. Built-in backpack-type straps would increase the ease of transporting the cooler and an integrated way to record the types of medication being carried in each compartment would also improve the efficiency of the delivery and vaccination process.

Kitty has mentioned she is in contact with an NHS health worker that uses these coolboxes, so hopefully we can get feedback on the most imporant deliverables for this product.

**Accessible to end-user**

Because this product will be an improvement on what is currently used and widely available in high income countries, and not a product that is key to solving a new problem, we must ensure that the useability is significantly better and keep the cost low to make it desirable and competitive. 

Use in a high income country will allow easily sourcing of parts for repair and maintenance. Our aim is to simplify the number of parts and make the design modular to it will be easy to repair and maintain, with minimal parts that could potentially fail.

**Context appropriate**

The current SMILE design for use in low income countries had to be designed to be robust in dusty and humid environments, and be able to keep the vaccines secure even during journeys over very rough terrain. For the coolbox for use in high income countries such as the UK, the effects of the climate will be much less severe, so dust proofing will be less of an issue and less insulation will be required. Waterproofing should be conisidered. 

The product could be made to allow a temperature sensor and display (such as the one being developed by the other team working with IDEABATIC) to be added if desired by the user, by replacing the door module with one including this.
